phpMyAdmin does not apply any special security methods to the MySQL
database server. It is still the system administrator's job to grant
permissions on the MySQL databases properly. phpMyAdmin's "Privileges"
page can be used for this.

Warning for :abbr:`Mac (Apple Macintosh)` users: if you are on a
:abbr:`Mac (Apple Macintosh)` :abbr:`OS (operating system)` version
before :abbr:`OS (operating system)` X, StuffIt unstuffs with
:abbr:`Mac (Apple Macintosh)` formats. So you'll have to resave as in
BBEdit to Unix style ALL phpMyAdmin scripts before uploading them to
your server, as PHP seems not to like :abbr:`Mac (Apple
Macintosh)`-style end of lines character ("``\r``").

.. _quick_install:

Quick Install
+++++++++++++

#. Choose an appropriate distribution kit from the phpmyadmin.net
   Downloads page. Some kits contain only the English messages, others
   contain all languages in UTF-8 format (this should be fine in most
   situations), others contain all languages and all character sets.
   We'll assume you chose a kit whose name looks like ``phpMyAdmin-x.x.x
   -all-languages.tar.gz``.
#. Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the subdirectories):
   ``tar -xzvf phpMyAdmin\_x.x.x-all-languages.tar.gz`` in your
   webserver's document root. If you don't have direct access to your
   document root, put the files in a directory on your local machine,
   and, after step 4, transfer the directory on your web server using,
   for example, ftp.
#. Ensure that all the scripts have the appropriate owner (if PHP is
   running in safe mode, having some scripts with an owner different from
   the owner of other scripts will be a problem). See :ref:`faq4_2` and
   :ref:`faq1_26` for suggestions.
#. Now you must configure your installation. There are two methods that
   can be used. Traditionally, users have hand-edited a copy of
   ``config.inc.php``, but now a wizard-style setup script is provided
   for those who prefer a graphical installation. Creating a
   ``config.inc.php`` is still a quick way to get started and needed for
   some advanced features.


Manualy creating file
---------------------

To manually create the file, simply use your text editor to create the
file ``config.inc.php`` (you can copy ``config.sample.inc.php`` to get
minimal configuration file) in the main (top-level) phpMyAdmin
directory (the one that contains ``index.php``). phpMyAdmin first
loads ``libraries/config.default.php`` and then overrides those values
with anything found in ``config.inc.php``. If the default value is
okay for a particular setting, there is no need to include it in
``config.inc.php``. You'll need a few directives to get going, a
simple configuration may look like this:

.. code-block:: none

    
    <?php
    $cfg['blowfish_secret'] = 'ba17c1ec07d65003';  // use here a value of your choice
    
    $i=0;
    $i++;
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'cookie';
    ?>

Or, if you prefer to not be prompted every time you log in:

.. code-block:: none

    
    <?php
    
    $i=0;
    $i++;
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['user']          = 'root';
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password']      = 'cbb74bc'; // use here your password
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_type']     = 'config';
    ?>

For a full explanation of possible configuration values, see the  of
this document.

.. _setup_script:

Using Setup script
------------------

Instead of manually editing ``config.inc.php``, you can use the `Setup
Script <setup/>`_. First you must manually create a folder ``config``
in the phpMyAdmin directory. This is a security measure. On a
Linux/Unix system you can use the following commands:

.. code-block:: none

    
    cd phpMyAdmin
    mkdir config                        # create directory for saving
    chmod o+rw config                   # give it world writable permissions

And to edit an existing configuration, copy it over first:

.. code-block:: none

    
    cp config.inc.php config/           # copy current configuration for editing
    chmod o+w config/config.inc.php     # give it world writable permissions

On other platforms, simply create the folder and ensure that your web
server has read and write access to it. :ref:`faq1_26` can help with
this.

Next, open `setup/ <setup/>`_ in your browser. Note that **changes are
not saved to disk until explicitly choose ``Save``** from the
*Configuration* area of the screen. Normally the script saves the new
config.inc.php to the ``config/`` directory, but if the webserver does
not have the proper permissions you may see the error "Cannot load or
save configuration." Ensure that the ``config/`` directory exists and
has the proper permissions - or use the ``Download`` link to save the
config file locally and upload (via FTP or some similar means) to the
proper location.

Once the file has been saved, it must be moved out of the ``config/``
directory and the permissions must be reset, again as a security
measure:

.. code-block:: none

    
    mv config/config.inc.php .         # move file to current directory
    chmod o-rw config.inc.php          # remove world read and write permissions
    rm -rf config                      # remove not needed directory

Now the file is ready to be used. You can choose to review or edit the
file with your favorite editor, if you prefer to set some advanced
options which the setup script does not provide.

#. If you are using the ``auth\_type`` "config", it is suggested that you
   protect the phpMyAdmin installation directory because using config
   does not require a user to enter a password to access the phpMyAdmin
   installation. Use of an alternate authentication method is
   recommended, for example with HTTPâ€“AUTH in a  file or switch to using
   ``auth\_type`` cookie or http. See the  of this :abbr:`FAQ (Frequently
   Asked Questions)` for additional information, especially
   :ref:`faq4_4`.
#. Open the `main phpMyAdmin directory <index.php>`_ in your browser.
   phpMyAdmin should now display a welcome screen and your databases, or
   a login dialog if using :abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)` or
   cookie authentication mode.
#. You should deny access to the ``./libraries`` and ``./setup/lib``
   subfolders in your webserver configuration. For Apache you can use
   supplied  file in that folder, for other webservers, you should
   configure this yourself. Such configuration prevents from possible
   path exposure and cross side scripting vulnerabilities that might
   happen to be found in that code.
#. It is generally good idea to protect public phpMyAdmin installation
   against access by robots as they usually can not do anything good
   there. You can do this using ``robots.txt`` file in root of your
   webserver or limit access by web server configuration, see
   :ref:`faq1_42`.

.. _linked-tables:

phpMyAdmin configuration storage
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For a whole set of new features (bookmarks, comments, :abbr:`SQL
(structured query language)`-history, tracking mechanism, :abbr:`PDF
(Portable Document Format)`-generation, column contents
transformation, etc.) you need to create a set of special tables.
Those tables can be located in your own database, or in a central
database for a multi-user installation (this database would then be
accessed by the controluser, so no other user should have rights to
it).

Please look at your ``./examples/`` directory, where you should find a
file called *create\_tables.sql*. (If you are using a Windows server,
pay special attention to :ref:`faq1_23`).

If you already had this infrastructure and upgraded to MySQL 4.1.2 or
newer, please use *./examples/upgrade\_tables\_mysql\_4\_1\_2+.sql*
and then create new tables by importing
*./examples/create\_tables.sql*.

You can use your phpMyAdmin to create the tables for you. Please be
aware that you may need special (administrator) privileges to create
the database and tables, and that the script may need some tuning,
depending on the database name.

After having imported the *./examples/create\_tables.sql* file, you
should specify the table names in your *./config.inc.php* file. The
directives used for that can be found in the . You will also need to
have a controluser with the proper rights to those tables (see section
below).

.. _upgrading:

Upgrading from an older version
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Simply copy *./config.inc.php* from your previous installation into
the newly unpacked one. Configuration files from old versions may
require some tweaking as some options have been changed or removed.
For compatibility with PHP 6, remove a
``set\_magic\_quotes\_runtime(0);`` statement that you might find near
the end of your configuration file.

You should **not** copy ``libraries/config.default.php`` over
``config.inc.php`` because the default configuration file is version-
specific.

If you have upgraded your MySQL server from a version previous to
4.1.2 to version 5.x or newer and if you use the phpMyAdmin
configuration storage, you should run the :abbr:`SQL (structured query
language)` script found in
``examples/upgrade\_tables\_mysql\_4\_1\_2+.sql``.

.. _authentication_modes:

Using authentication modes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* :abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)` and cookie authentication
  modes are recommended in a **multi-user environment** where you want
  to give users access to their own database and don't want them to play
  around with others. Nevertheless be aware that MS Internet Explorer
  seems to be really buggy about cookies, at least till version 6. Even
  in a **single-user environment**, you might prefer to use :abbr:`HTTP
  (HyperText Transfer Protocol)` or cookie mode so that your
  user/password pair are not in clear in the configuration file.
* :abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)` and cookie authentication
  modes are more secure: the MySQL login information does not need to be
  set in the phpMyAdmin configuration file (except possibly for the ).
  However, keep in mind that the password travels in plain text, unless
  you are using the HTTPS protocol. In cookie mode, the password is
  stored, encrypted with the blowfish algorithm, in a temporary cookie.
* Note: this section is only applicable if your MySQL server is running
  with ``--skip-show-database``. For ':abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transfer
  Protocol)`' and 'cookie' modes, phpMyAdmin needs a controluser that
  has **only** the ``SELECT`` privilege on the *`mysql`.`user` (all
  columns except `Password`)*, *`mysql`.`db` (all columns)*,
  *`mysql`.`host` (all columns)* and *`mysql`.`tables\_priv` (all
  columns except `Grantor` and `Timestamp`)* tables. You must specify
  the details for the  in the ``config.inc.php`` file under the  and
  settings. The following example assumes you want to use ``pma`` as the
  controluser and ``pmapass`` as the controlpass, but **this is only an
  example: use something else in your file!** Input these statements
  from the phpMyAdmin :abbr:`SQL (structured query language)` Query
  window or mysql commandâ€“line client. Of course you have to replace
  ``localhost`` with the webserver's host if it's not the same as the
  MySQL server's one.  If you want to use the many new relation and
  bookmark features:  (this of course requires that your  be set up).

       GRANT SELECT (Host, Db, User, Table_name, Table_priv, Column_priv)
       ON mysql.tables_priv TO 'pma'@'localhost';
       
       If you want to use the many new relation and bookmark features:
       
       
       GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON <pma_db>.* TO 'pma'@'localhost';
       
       
       (this of course requires that your phpMyAdmin
       configuration storage be set up).
       
       Then each of the true users should be granted a set of privileges
       on a set of particular databases. Normally you shouldn't give global
       privileges to an ordinary user, unless you understand the impact of those
       privileges (for example, you are creating a superuser).
       For example, to grant the user real_user with all privileges on
       the database user_base:
       
       GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON user_base.* TO 'real_user'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'real_password';

':abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)`' authentication mode
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Uses :abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)` Basic authentication
  method and allows you to log in as any valid MySQL user.
* Is supported with most PHP configurations. For :abbr:`IIS (Internet
  Information Services)` (:abbr:`ISAPI (Internet Server Application
  Programming Interface)`) support using :abbr:`CGI (Common Gateway
  Interface)` PHP see :ref:`faq1_32`, for using with Apache :abbr:`CGI
  (Common Gateway Interface)` see :ref:`faq1_35`.
* See also :ref:`faq4_4` about not using the  mechanism along with
  ':abbr:`HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)`' authentication mode.


'cookie' authentication mode
----------------------------

* You can use this method as a replacement for the :abbr:`HTTP
  (HyperText Transfer Protocol)` authentication (for example, if you're
  running :abbr:`IIS (Internet Information Services)`).
* Obviously, the user must enable cookies in the browser, but this is
  now a requirement for all authentication modes.
* With this mode, the user can truly log out of phpMyAdmin and log in
  back with the same username.
* If you want to log in to arbitrary server see  directive.
* As mentioned in the  section, having the ``mcrypt`` extension will
  speed up access considerably, but is not required.


'signon' authentication mode
----------------------------

* This mode is a convenient way of using credentials from another
  application to authenticate to phpMyAdmin.
* The other application has to store login information into session
  data.
* More details in the  section.


'config' authentication mode
----------------------------

* This mode is the less secure one because it requires you to fill the
  and  fields (and as a result, anyone who can read your config.inc.php
  can discover your username and password).  But you don't need to setup
  a "controluser" here: using the  might be enough.
* In the :ref:`faqmultiuser` section, there is an entry explaining how
  to protect your configuration file.
* For additional security in this mode, you may wish to consider the
  Host authentication  and  configuration directives.
* Unlike cookie and http, does not require a user to log in when first
  loading the phpMyAdmin site. This is by design but could allow any
  user to access your installation. Use of some restriction method is
  suggested, perhaps a  file with the HTTP-AUTH directive or disallowing
  incoming HTTP requests at oneâ€™s router or firewall will suffice (both
  of which are beyond the scope of this manual but easily searchable
  with Google).

.. _swekey:

Swekey authentication
---------------------

The Swekey is a low cost authentication USB key that can be used in
web applications. When Swekey authentication is activated, phpMyAdmin
requires the users's Swekey to be plugged before entering the login
page (currently supported for cookie authentication mode only). Swekey
Authentication is disabled by default. To enable it, add the following
line to ``config.inc.php``:

.. code-block:: none

    
    $cfg['Servers'][$i]['auth_swekey_config'] = '/etc/swekey.conf';

You then have to create the ``swekey.conf`` file that will associate
each user with their Swekey Id. It is important to place this file
outside of your web server's document root (in the example, it is
located in ``/etc``). A self documented sample file is provided in the
``examples`` directory. Feel free to use it with your own users'
information. If you want to purchase a Swekey please visit
`http://phpmyadmin.net/auth\_key <http://phpmyadmin.net/auth_key>`_
since this link provides funding for phpMyAdmin.
